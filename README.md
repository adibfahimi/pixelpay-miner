# Pixelpay Miner

This project is a miner specifically designed for [Pixelpay](https://github.com/adibfahimi/pixelpay). It allows you to mine Pixelpay either solo or in a pool.

## Getting Started

### Solo Mining

To start mining solo, use the following command:

```bash
pixelpay-miner -solo -address YOUR_ADDRESS -node-address eu.pixelpay.org
```

Replace `YOUR_ADDRESS` with your actual Pixelpay address.

### Pool Mining

If you prefer to mine in a pool, use the following command:

```bash
pixelpay-miner -pool -address YOUR_ADDRESS -pool-address pool.pixelpay.org
```

Again, replace `YOUR_ADDRESS` with your actual Pixelpay address.
Happy mining!
